Figma\u2019s platform helps teams bring ideas to life\u2014whether you're brainstorming, creating a prototype, translating designs into code, or iterating with AI. From idea to product, Figma empowers teams to streamline workflows, move faster, and work together in real time from anywhere in the world. If you're excited to shape the future of design and collaboration, join us! Figma is growing our team of passionate creatives and builders on a mission to make design accessible to all. Figma\u2019s platform helps teams bring ideas to life\u2014whether you're brainstorming, creating a prototype, translating designs into code, or iterating with AI. From idea to product, Figma empowers teams to streamline workflows, move faster, and work together in real time from anywhere in the world. If you're excited to shape the future of design and collaboration, join us! At Figma we truly believe that design does not end in Figma or with your designer, it\u2019s just one part. Design encompasses everything that goes into the product you eventually ship to your customers. Whether that is the code you write to tie it all together, your CI/CD infrastructure that gives you confidence that your products work as expected, or the documentation you write to keep everyone on the same page. The developer tools pillar at Figma is responsible for the development lifecycle of this design process, the handoff between designers and developers, and closing the loop from production back to design. Our goal is to enable frontend engineers to move (much) faster, spending less time on mundane tasks, and most importantly enable them to deliver the highest quality products to their end users. In 2023, we launched Dev Mode , a suite of features that gives developers everything they need to navigate design files and transform designs into code. With Dev Mode, designers and developers stay in sync , making sure vital details aren\u2019t lost in the handoff process. Since then, we\u2019ve expanded our efforts with features like Code Connect, which links components in Figma directly to code in your production codebase, and the MCP server, which enables AI-assisted translation of design into code through integrations with AI coding tools. The team partners with other product and engineering teams to ensure Figma continues to push the boundaries of collaboration between design and engineering. Looking ahead, we're focused on going far beyond handoff - building the next generation of AI-powered tools that make frontend development faster, smarter, and more connected to design than ever before. Most of Figma\u2019s developer surfaces are built on Typescript, React/Redux, and WebAssembly . This allows us to develop rapidly while maintaining performance & type safety.

Figma\u2019s platform helps teams bring ideas to life\u2014whether you're brainstorming, creating a prototype, translating designs into code, or iterating with AI. From idea to product, Figma empowers teams to streamline workflows, move faster, and work together in real time from anywhere in the world. If you're excited to shape the future of design and collaboration, join us! Our Creation Engine teams work on some of the core technologies that power our real time, browser-based Figma Design and FigJam products. These teams work mostly (but not exclusively) on client-side code that runs in the browser. Under the hood, Figma shares a lot of similarities to a game engine. We develop this C++/WebAssembly engine to ensure internal and external developers can rapidly build new products and features that are fast and reliable by default, and own areas such as our in-memory data model (SceneGraph), renderer, and multiplayer client/server protocols. Within Creation Engine, the Rendering & Animation team focuses on the lowest level of the stack, where we convert the SceneGraph into primitive rendering operations that are executed on the GPU using WebGL. Our team houses the company\u2019s expertise in rendering of 2D vector graphics, rendering algorithms, rendering APIs, and GPU profiling and optimization. Our mission is to make rendering performant, feature-rich, reliable, maintainable, and extendable across all products and surfaces. Rendering & Animation engineers use a combination of C++ and TypeScript for CPU-side code (to support our two renderers); our shaders are written in GLSL. The team recently completed a large project to replace our legacy rendering backend with a new one - \u201cTinyGPU\u201d - that is more modern, much smaller, and easier to work with. This project has laid the groundwork for a new era focused on feature expansion, performance optimization, advanced animation, and future product launches. Each new product at Figma pushes beyond our previous rendering assumptions, requiring constant innovation and visionary foundations. The Rendering & Animation team is looking for engineers with domain expertise in rendering algorithms and APIs, as well as both high- and low-level performance optimization. Experience relating to rendering of 2D vector graphics specifically is a plus, but not required! We\u2019re looking for someone who is excited to explore the latest graphics technologies like WebGPU, plus develop and implement new algorithmic techniques for things like high-performance antialiasing. Figma is a highly collaborative organization and most projects are owned by small teams of 2-3 people. You\u2019ll form strong relationships with product managers and designers, and can expect to partner regularly with engineers and leaders beyond your immediate team. We strive to foster an inclusive culture that promotes equity and belonging, and use the following values to guide how we work together: communicate early and often, lift your team, focus on craftsmanship, and prioritize impact. You can learn more about our engineering values and how we developed them here . This is a full-time role that can be held from one of our US hubs or remotely in the United States. What you\u2019ll do at Figma: Work closely with teammates and partners in Engineering, Product, Design, Marketing, User Research, and Data Science to build new features and achieve roadmap goals. We prioritize collaboration and cross-functional partnerships, so you won\u2019t operate in silos. Some efforts you might impact include: Creating and optimizing shaders to render blurs of primitive shapes in a single pass Improving how we order and batch draws to reduce draw calls and render target switches Developing and implementing faster approaches to anti-aliasing (an open area of research in 2D vector graphics!) Implementing performant animations using multiple layer caches for fast compositing Drive guidance, quality, and standards for rendering at Figma, and explore opportunities that keep us on the bleeding edge of new capability and advancements. Be a mentor and provide thoughtful feedback to your peers, and benefit from strong personal and professional mentorship opportunities yourself. Contribute to org-wide initiatives like new hire onboarding, interview process development, and Belonging/Equity/Inclusion efforts. Continue ramping and learning. The technical challenges you'll tackle on the Rendering & Animation team are unique, fun, ambitious, and ever-evolving. We'd love to hear from you if you have: 8+ years of professional experience shipping software with a specialization on Rendering and Graphics (2D or 3D), ideally with experience in C++/WebAssembly. Experience working on game engines, client-side technologies and platforms, and rendering APIs like OpenGL, WebGL, WebGPU, Vulkan, Metal, or DirectX. Demonstrated fluency with one or more low-level programming languages, including but not limited to: C++, C, Objective-C, Go, or Rust.
